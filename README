*Project of a 16 bit cpu done with the help of AMDs and Xilinx application called Vivado
*It was implemented as part of the Computer Architecture Course in the University of Prishtina, Computer Engineering Department


-The cpu was based on FPGA and it's a Single Cycle Datapath MIPS based which supports the instructions:

	AND, OR, ADD, SUB, LW and Beq 

-The source code is located at the Code/ directory and the testing part is found at TestBench/

-To run it, you have install the Vivado program run it just like any other Vivado project 

-The project as of 2024-08-09 needs some work to be fully finished, and extended to Multi Cycle Datapath
